# Data Visualization

## General information

**Summary**

Data visualisation is one of the most powerful tools to explore, understand and communicate patterns in quantitative information. At the same time, good data visualisation is a surprisingly difficult task and demands three quite different skills: substantive knowledge, statistical skill, and artistic sense. The course is intended to introduce participants to a) key principles of graphical perception and analytic design, b) useful visualisation techniques for the exploration and presentation of various forms of data and c) new developments of data visualisation for the social sciences, such as visual inference and visualising statistical models.
